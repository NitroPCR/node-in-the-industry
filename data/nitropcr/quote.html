  Node.js allows us to easily manage patient care reports for our customers
  across thousands of mobile devices. Node's non-blocking network model allows us 
  to serve and scale to thousands of mobile clients with a simple REST API
  with no performance hits, all while running on modest cloud based virtual servers.
